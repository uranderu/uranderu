### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As of August 2021 I moved all my repositories to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/uranderu) for the very simple reason that I don't trust GitHub anymore. The whole disregard to adhere to the licenses I chose for my repositories regarding GitHub Copilot was a breach of trust for me. I only keep this account to be able to contribute to open source projects that are hosted on here.
